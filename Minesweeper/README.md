# Minesweeper
A java-based recreation of the classic Minesweeper game. Try to flag all the hidden mines on a grid without clicking one directly!

### Installation
This is a standalone program. Just compile and run or use the included jar file!

### Usage
This GUI-based game plays just like the traditional Minesweeper game!

- There are three difficulty levels, selectable through the menu: easy, medium, and hard.
- Click on any tile to sweep the area. Numbers on a tile indicate how many mines surround it.
- Right-click to flag a tile as a mine, and cannot be swept or accidentally clicked.
- When only mines remain, you win!
