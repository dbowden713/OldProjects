# Connect Four

A simple java-based implementation of the classic Connect Four game.

### Installation

This is a standalone program. Just compile with Java or use the included jar file!

### Usage

Just click above the board to make your move! Two players, red and black, take turns placing chips until one player gets four in a row (in any direction). Game progress is automatically saved and can be reloaded next time the program runs. Statistics for the current session are tracked and shown when players choose not to make a new game.
