### Connect Four
A simple java-based implementation of the classic Connect Four game.

### Multicast Chat Client
This java-based program creates a simple chatroom-style client that communicates over Multicast.

### RO Item Manager
A python-based console program for the MMORPG, Ragnarok Online. Allows editing client-side item descriptions, to add special flags for important items (quest items, crafting items, etc.).

### TFTP UDP Client
This java-based program uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to send files via TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol).

### RO Custom Resolution
A console-based C++ code snippet for the MMORPG, Ragnarok Online. Modifies the game's registry settings to allow a custom screen resolution outside the normal presets in the game's settings.

### RO Item Checker
A small C#-based program I wrote to help a developer on a small private server for the MMORPG, Ragnarok Online. Parses a flatfile database of items in the game and returns a list of items with a specific script type (OnUnequip_Script).
