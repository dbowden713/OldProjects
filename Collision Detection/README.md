# Collision Detection
A small python-based OpenGL program that tests collision detection with the walls of a room.

### Installation
This program requires Python (2 and 3 supported) and [PyOpenGL](opengl.sourceforge.net) to run.

Once these have been installed, just run `collision_detection.py`!

### Usage
This is a very simple program with basic movement controls:

- Use WASD to walk/strafe.
- Use arrow keys to look around.
- Press M to toggle an on-screen menu.
- Press Z to show position on the screen.

Note that the back and side walls have collision detection, preventing you from walking through them.
