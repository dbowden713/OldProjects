# Scary Room
A small python-based OpenGL program that creates a scary room with an enemy that slowly chases you!

### Installation
This program requires both Python (2 and 3 supported) and [PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/) to run. Once these are installed just run `scary_room.py`!

### Usage
There are various commands and keybinds to move around and control the room. There is an in-game HUD with mose of these commands, but they are listed here as well:

- Use WASD to walk and strafe.
- Use arrow keys to change directions.
- Use F to toggle fog. Fog can be room-bound or global.
- Use L to toggle lighting effects.
- Use M to toggle the HUD.
- Use Z to toggle position text on the HUD.
