A python-based console program for the MMORPG, Ragnarok Online. Allows editing client-side item descriptions, to add special flags for important items (quest items, crafting items, etc.).

- EXIT - closes the program
- FIND - search for an item by name
- SAVE - saves new item descriptions to a new file (in the mods folder)
