# Hypothetical OS
A java-based operating system emulation written for a term project. Uses various process scheduling and memory management techniques (first-in first-out, round robin, etc.) for time on the processor.

*See the wiki for a detailed breakdown of this program!*

### Installation
This is a standalone program. Compile with java and run, run the pre-compiled class files located in the build folder, or just run the included jar file in the build folder!

### Usage
- This program runs and closes automatically once the simulation is finished.

- The simulation schedules 20 jobs to run over the course of 30 time units.

- A text file is generated for each simulation depending on the job scheduling and memory management technique used.

- All jobs are executed with a variety of process scheduling and memory management techniques:
